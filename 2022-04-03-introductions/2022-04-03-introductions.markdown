Hello! It's me! I'm back and updating again. I'll be honest, I don't feel like giving a whole update on where I've been. Short version is that the Pandemic happened, is still happening, and it's no different than everyone else. What is important however is that I had the opportunity to take stock of what frustrated me about my work and make a conscious decision to focus on the things I truly wanted to do. This is just a blurb, but I'll get into it as tie goes on. 

Still, it's nice to see you! Feel free to message me, DM's are open!
