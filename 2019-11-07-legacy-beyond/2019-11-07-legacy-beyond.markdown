For traditional application engineers with a few years under their belt, technology trends come and go. It’s hard to get excited when you’ve lost time to trends that never got adopted while the industry tells you that your language is dead. This talk will identify the source of these Legacy Feelings and define which skills can be immediately applied to the next step of your career. You’ll learn how to course correct in a cost and time effective way, including finding low friction paths for upskilling, the actual price of learning new technologies, and your options for online education and communities. Legacy is more than old tech, it’s experience you can monetize and use to innovate your future.
