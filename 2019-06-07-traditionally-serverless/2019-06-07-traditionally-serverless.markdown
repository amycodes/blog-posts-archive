For traditional application engineers with a few years under their belt, technology trends like Serverless come and go. It’s hard to get excited if you’ve already lost time and energy to a trend that never got adopted. This talk will go over common arguments and open a path to Serverless Adoption.

This talk was delivered at RevolutionConf in Virginia Beach, VA.
