The backbone of serverless architecture is using Functions as a Service to handle your logic needs. This is done by spinning up containers to run these functions on demand. For many use cases, this would be enough. Other times, you would need to manage small configurations such as time outs and memory. More often, a developer needs to use third-party libraries or a company built and maintained library. This talk will go over all of these options, how to choose which is the best for your particular use case, and how to implement them.

This talk was delivered at Serverless Days in Nashville, TN with content modified from ServerlessConf.
